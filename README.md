pack.ag/amqp is an AMQP 1.0 client implementation for Go.

AMQP 1.0 is not compatible with AMQP 0-9-1 or 0-10, which are
the most common AMQP protocols in use today.

This project is currently alpha status, though is currently being used by my employer
in a pre-production capacity. The current focus is reading from Microsoft Azure's Service Bus.

API is subject to change until 1.0.0. If you choose to use this library, please vendor it.

## Install

```
go get -u pack.ag/amqp
```

## Example Usage

``` go
package mypackage

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"pack.ag/amqp"
)

func main() {
	// Create client
	client, err := amqp.Dial("amqps://my-namespace.servicebus.windows.net",
		amqp.ConnSASLPlain("access-key-name", "access-key"),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Dialing AMQP server:", err)
	}
	defer client.Close()

	// Open a session
	session, err := client.NewSession()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Creating AMQP session:", err)
	}

	// Create a receiver
	receiver, err := session.NewReceiver(
		amqp.LinkAddress("/queue-name"),
		amqp.LinkCredit(10),
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Creating receiver link:", err)
	}

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	for {
		// Receive next message
		msg, err := receiver.Receive(ctx)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal("Reading message from AMQP:", err)
		}

		// Accept message
		msg.Accept()

		fmt.Printf("Message received: %s\n", msg.Data)
	}
}
```

### Notable Bugs/Shortcomings

- [ ] Closing a sessions does not send an end performative.
- [ ] Testing should be improved. Currently fuzz testing and basic Azure Service Bus integration testing is being performed.

### Features - Short Term

- [ ] Set sender filters to support Azure Event Hubs.

### Features - Medium Term

- [X] Support message producer operations. (Supported as of 0.2.0)

### Other Notes

By default, this package depends only on the standard library. Building with the
`pkgerrors` tag will cause errors to be created/wrapped by the github.com/pkg/errors
library. This can be useful for debugging and when used in a project using
github.com/pkg/errors.
